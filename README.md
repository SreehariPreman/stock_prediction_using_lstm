# Stock Prediction with RNN-LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The dataset used is historical stock data for Google.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning, specifically RNN-LSTM, to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future stock prices. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used is historical stock data for Google. It includes features such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and trading volume. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
